Looking at PolyMaps (http://polymaps.org/), there are examples they have generated which closely mirror the sort of thing we want for NI - explicitly, the population and unemployment examples.

Because it uses SVGs to illustrate the info, the maps can be styled with CSS.

This would be a markup approach, rather than purely illustrative using maps.
