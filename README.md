NI-Electoral-Areas
==================

Working to map the revised DEAs in Northern Ireland.

In 2015, the local government structure in Northern Ireland is changing significantly. This has a knock-on effect on the electoral map for Assembly and Westminster elections too.

The website WIMPS.tv has a built-in electoral mapping function, whereby entering by searching for any postcode, a User is shown the political representatives at local, Assembly, Westminister, and European level for that postcode.

With the changes in District Electoral Areas, this database will need to be significantly updated.


There are two further issues:

1. For 2014-15, local councils will have two elected bodies functioning simultaneously: the old, 26 councils; and the 11 new, shadow, 'super-councils' in a transitional state.

2. The change in electoral map throws up more inconstencies than before when it comes to rely on postcodes as an accurate system for mapping DEA boundaries: for example, within Belfast there are now several instances where two homes with the same postcode actually fall within different constituencies.


With the latter issue in mind, it's worth considering if a new, graphical, map-based approach to the database would make sense.

For example, the workflow could be:

1. Mapping a location on (e.g.) Google Maps via their API; this could be done via address search, or location search;

2. Using that location reference to locate on a custom DEA map;

3. Generating a list of politicians relevant to that DEA.
